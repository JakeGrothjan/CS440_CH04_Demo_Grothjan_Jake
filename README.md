CS440 Demo Repo My Justification Here: 


I chose the Apache license because of the different attriubtes of this license. One particular attribute is the grant of copyright license. This is important because it allows you to reproduce, distribute, and perform workm on public pieces of work, such as developing code based on someone else's work with the consent of the owner and copyright statement. This license gives you the freedom to develop more easily while also retaining to the rules of the U.S. copyright laws. This license also supports the Fair Use Doctrine, ensuring the purpose of the copyright is for commercial or non-profit uses. The Apache license makes it ethical for copyright use, which is why it was chosen for this.
